First landing page on the odin project

# What the project is about

The project is intended to show random information as its intent in the curriculum is to practise positioning of elements using mainly flexbox with some editing tools.

# What have I learned so far?

In this project I implemented the use of some more specific semantic tags in comparison to the <a href="https://github.com/hroglardev/odin-recipes">recipes project</a> as well as basic styles. Below you can find a list of the new things I learned.

Tags

<ul>
  <li>Article</li>
  <li>Section</li>
  <li>Header</li>
  <li>Main</li>
  <li>Footer</li>
  <li>Section</li>
</ul>
